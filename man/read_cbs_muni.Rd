\title{Read a municipal data file to a tibble}
\usage{
read_cbs_muni(path, year, data_domain = c("physical", "budget"))
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{A character vector of length 1, denoting the local file path to the
municipal data file. A full list of available files by the CBS is at the
\href{https://www.cbs.gov.il/he/publications/Pages/2019/\%D7\%94\%D7\%A8\%D7\%A9\%D7\%95\%D7\%99\%D7\%95\%D7\%AA-\%D7\%94\%D7\%9E\%D7\%A7\%D7\%95\%D7\%9E\%D7\%99\%D7\%95\%D7\%AA-\%D7\%91\%D7\%99\%D7\%A9\%D7\%A8\%D7\%90\%D7\%9C-\%D7\%A7\%D7\%95\%D7\%91\%D7\%A6\%D7\%99-\%D7\%A0\%D7\%AA\%D7\%95\%D7\%A0\%D7\%99\%D7\%9D-\%D7\%9C\%D7\%A2\%D7\%99\%D7\%91\%D7\%95\%D7\%93-1999-2017.aspx}{relevant CBS page}.}

\item{year}{A numeric vector of length 1 denoting which year the data file
pointed in \code{path} is for. Currently supporting only 2016 and later, since before
2016 regional councils are split from cities and local councils.}

\item{data_domain}{A character vector of length 1, one of \code{c("physical", "budget")}.
Every Excel municipal data file has a few different data domains, most notably
physical and population data, and budget data.}
}
\value{
A tibble with municipal data for a specific year, where every row is a
municipality and every column is a different variable for this municipality in
that year. Be advised all columns are of type character, so you nee to parse
the data types yourself at will.
}
\description{
This function is a wrapper around \code{readxl::readexcel()}, reading a specific
municipal data file for a specific year and a specific data domain. Its added
value is in its use of \code{row_to_names_fill()} and its pre-defined parameters for
every year and its specific quirks in the Excel headers.
